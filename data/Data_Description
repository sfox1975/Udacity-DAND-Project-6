Searching for ‘Employees’ and ‘Net Sales’ within each year’s 10-K quickly brings up the annual employment count (as of December 31st of any given year) and the Net Sales (in $ millions generally) for the current year and the previous 2-4 years as well.

This search was conducted for 2000 - 2015, typed into Excel and saved as a .csv file.
