## Summary

The purpose of my data visualization is to demonstrate the rapid growth in employment by Amazon over the last 15 years, and how that growth has been fueled by sales growth and major new product launches. Given the huge number of job openings in my town (Seattle) listed by Amazon, I wanted to further understand how their employment numbers have changed over time and also to put these numbers into the context of how much revenue the company is generating and also when new products were launched. To do so, I have constructed a timeline that demonstrates that employment growth has in fact lagged sales growth (i.e. outstanding sales appear to be driving the huge need for new employees) and have also overlaid the timeline with a few select key product launches (Prime, AWS, Kindle, Studio and Echo).


## Design

I decided that 2000 - 2015 would be an interesting period to cover, given that it covers all of the 21st century and provides a relatively long time frame while also ensuring the final graphic would not be too crowded. Since Amazon became a publicly traded in 1997, data from 2000 onwards was relatively easy to obtain from the company’s public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). Given that this is a time series of data, I opted to use line graphs for my initial design. I also decided to use two y-axes, allowing me to simultaneously show employment and sales figures. 

The initial design sketch was as follows:
